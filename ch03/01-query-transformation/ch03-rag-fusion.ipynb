    "\n",
    "One of the major problems with a basic RAG system is that it relies too heavily on the quality of a user’s query to generate an accurate output. In a production setting, a user is likely to construct their query in an incomplete, ambiguous, or poorly worded manner that leads to model hallucination.\n",

    "### RAG_Fusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The RAG-Fusion strategy shares similarities with the multi-query retrieval strategy, except we will apply a final reranking step to all the retrieved documents. This reranking step makes use of the _reciprocal rank fusion_ (RRF) algorithm, which involves combining the ranks of different search results to produce a single, unified ranking. By combining ranks from different queries, we pull the most relevant documents to the top of the final list. RRF is well-suited for combining results from\n",
    "queries that might have different scales or distributions of scores.\n",
