    "One of the major problems with a basic RAG system is that it relies too heavily on the quality of a user’s query to generate an accurate output. In a production setting, a user is likely to construct their query in an incomplete, ambiguous, or poorly worded manner that leads to model hallucination.\n",

    "\n",
    "_Hypothetical Document Embeddings_ (HyDE) is a strategy that involves creating a hypothetical document based on the user’s query, embedding the document, and retrieving relevant documents based on vector similarity. The intuition behind HyDE is that an LLM-generated hypothetical document will be more similar to the most relevant documents than the original query.\n",
